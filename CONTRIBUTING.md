# Contributing guide
This guide will help you help us improve this project

# Introduction
Firstly, thank you for taking the time to read this long document on how to contribute to our projects. We are very glad :)
So you want to contribute to our project? Thank you, it's because of awesome people like you that our project exists. So please, after you make your contribution, open a PR in [this repo](https://github.com/Higenku/Atributions) to add your name to our [contributor portal](https://higenku.org/acknowledgments).

Following these guidelines helps to communicate that you respect the time of the developers managing and developing this open source project. In return, they should reciprocate that respect in addressing your issue, assessing changes, and helping you finalize your Merge Requests.

# Ground Rules
Ensure you follow our [code of conduct](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/1/code_of_conduct/) 

Responsibilities:
* Ensure cross-platform compatibility for every change that's accepted. Windows, Mac and Linux.
* Ensure that code that goes into respects the coding conventions of the project you are contributing to. The coding conventions are specified in the Supplementary Guides of each project.
* Create issues for any major changes and enhancements that you wish to make. Discuss things transparently and get community feedback.
* Don't add random useless code that doesn't make any difference in the repository.
* Keep feature versions as small as possible, preferably one new feature per version.
* Be welcoming to newcomers and encourage diverse new contributors from all backgrounds.

## Code Style
Please follow the [Rust Coding style](https://rustc-dev-guide.rust-lang.org/conventions.html) in rust files. Except generated files.

## extending the api
It's recommended to open a issue with the requirements and planning before you start programming your extension.

After your extension is finished, just open a merge request and wait until we decide whether to merge it.
Happy coding
